I don't remember when I first heard Boards of Canada, but I remember the feeling: like remembering something that never happened.

## Why I stan

Most electronic music tries to sound like the future. BOC sounds like memories of a future that never came—public broadcast educational films from an alternate 1970s, half-remembered childhood, the texture of VHS decay.

They proved you could build *places* with sound. Not songs, places. Rooms you could walk through in your mind.

## What I learned from them

- **Nostalgia is generative.** You don't have to be stuck in it—you can use it as a building material.
- **Degradation is beautiful.** The warped tape, the worn edges, the places where things break down—that's where the life is.
- **Math can feel like magic.** Their sounds are incredibly precise, but the precision creates the dreaminess rather than destroying it.

## Essential listening

- *Music Has the Right to Children* (1998) — Start here
- *Geogaddi* (2002) — Darker, stranger, obsessed with subliminal messaging
- *The Campfire Headphase* (2005) — More guitars, more melancholy
- *Tomorrow's Harvest* (2013) — Cold war paranoia, the end of something

They release music about once a decade now. Every time feels like an event.
