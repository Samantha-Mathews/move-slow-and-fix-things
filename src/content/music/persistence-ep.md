Four tracks that came out of a residency exploring how memory works—loops that evolve, patterns that persist, spaces that breathe.

## Track listing

1. **Persistence of Vision** (5:23)
2. **Memory Palace** (4:47)
3. **Afterimage** (6:12)
4. **The Space Between** (7:01)

## The story behind it

I wrote most of this during a period when I was deep in research about the method of loci and how spatial memory works. The tracks are meant to feel like walking through a building you almost remember—familiar but slightly off.

The title track uses field recordings from the Seymour River, slowed down and granularized until they become something else entirely.
