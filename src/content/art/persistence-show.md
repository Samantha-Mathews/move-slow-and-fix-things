Can an autonomous AI be creative? We hosted an art show in both physical and virtual space to find out.

## The concept

We trained a system to generate artwork based on the theme of "persistence"—what survives, what endures, what refuses to disappear. The results were displayed simultaneously in a gallery space in LA and in a VR environment accessible from anywhere.

## What we learned

The most interesting pieces weren't the ones the AI generated alone—they were the ones where human and machine got into a kind of dialogue. The AI would propose something, we'd react, it would adapt.

> "The question isn't whether AI can be creative. It's whether creativity is something that happens between minds rather than inside them."

## Virtual space

The VR component used JanusVR to create an impossible architecture—a building that couldn't exist in physical space, where the artwork lived in rooms that folded into each other.
